Examples are: new Query('Account'). addConditionNotEq('Name', 'N/A'). run(); new Query('Account'). addConditionIn('Name', new Set{'ABC'}). run(); new Query('Account'). addConditionNotIn('Name', new Set{'N/A'}). run(); new Query('Account'). addConditionLt('NumberOfEmployees', 15). run(); new Query('Account'). addConditionLe('NumberOfEmployees', 10). run(); new Query('Account'). addConditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 5). run(); new Query('Account'). addConditionGe('NumberOfEmployees', 10). run(); new Query('Account'). addConditionLike('Name', '%ABC%'). run(); ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/tutorials/getting_started/step_5.md","id":"step_5","location":"/tutorials/getting_started/step_5.html","url":"/query-apex/tutorials/getting_started/step_5.html"},"step_6":{"title":"Conditions Part 2","description":"Add multiple conditions","buttonTitle":"Done","parentId":"getting_started","layout":"tutorial","time":90,"weight":6,"content":" {$page.title} In the previous section, we have learned to add a single condition to the query. In many cases, however, that is far from enough. So Query.apex allows calling 'addConditionXX' multiple times, resulting in combining all the conditions with boolean 'and' operation. Example: List accounts = new Query('Account'). addConditionEq('Name', 'Sam'). addConditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0). addConditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}). run(); equivalent to: List accounts = [ SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name = 'Sam' AND NumberOfEmployees 0 AND Phone IN :new Set{'+61 400 000 000'} ]; Meanwhile, Query.apex provides a method 'switchToDisjunction' to change the boolean 'and' operator to the boolean 'or' operator. Appending an extra 'switchToDisjunction' method to the same example above: List accounts = new Query('Account'). addConditionEq('Name', 'Sam'). addConditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0). addConditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}). switchToDisjunction(). run(); equivalent to: List accounts = [ SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name = 'Sam' OR NumberOfEmployees 0 OR Phone IN :new Set{'+61 400 000 000'} ]; ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/tutorials/getting_started/step_6.md","id":"step_6","location":"/tutorials/getting_started/step_6.html","url":"/query-apex/tutorials/getting_started/step_6.html"},"step_7":{"title":"Conditions Part 3","description":"Add more complex conditions","buttonTitle":"Done","parentId":"getting_started","layout":"tutorial","time":180,"weight":7,"content":" {$page.title} We have learned to add multiple conditions in the previous section, but those conditions were very limited. What if we want to construct a condition with a combination of both boolean operators? In order to do that, we have to construct a 'Condition' variable, before combining these conditions with the boolean operations, followed by an 'addCondition' method to link the condition with the query. A typical example would be: List accounts = new Query('Account'). addCondition( Query.doOr( Query.conditionEq('Name', 'Sam'), Query.doAnd( Query.conditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0), Query.conditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}) ) ) ). run(); This statement is equivalent to: List accounts = [ SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name = 'Sam' OR ( NumberOfEmployees 0 AND Phone IN :new Set{'+61 400 000 000'} ) ]; Let me explain the example step by step. 'Query.conditionXX' are a series static methods that construct a 'Condition' variable, similar to the member methods 'addCondtionXX', these include: 'conditionNotEq', 'conditionIn', 'conditionNotIn', 'conditionLt', 'conditionLe', 'conditionGt', 'conditionGe' and 'conditionLike'. Then, we can run boolean operations on any 'Condition' variables. Because the fact that 'AND' and 'OR' have been reserved keyword in apex language, we have to use 'doAnd' and 'doOr' as replacement method names. These two methods are both static methods, with 'Condition' as the return type, so that the return value can be a parameter of another boolean operation. A sample code from the example above: Query.Condition condition = Query.doAnd( Query.conditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0), Query.conditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}) ); A more complicated example from above: Query.Condition condition = Query.doOr( Query.conditionEq('Name', 'Sam'), Query.doAnd( Query.conditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0), Query.conditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}) ) ); It's also possible to pass up to 4 parameters in each boolean operation: Query.Condition condition = Query.doOr( Query.conditionEq('Name', 'Sam'), Query.conditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0), Query.conditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}), Query.conditionEq('Email', 'sam@tarly.com') ); Once we have constructed our Condition variable, we can pass the condition to the query, using its member method 'addCondition'. Let's try a simple condition first: Query.Condition condition = Query.conditionEq('Name', 'Sam'); List accounts = new Query('Account'). addCondition(condition). run(); which is indeed equivalent to: List accounts = new Query('Account'). addConditionEq('Name', 'Sam'). run(); But this time, we can create more complicated conditions: Query.Condition condition = Query.doOr( Query.conditionEq('Name', 'Sam'), Query.doAnd( Query.conditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0), Query.conditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}) ) ); List accounts = new Query('Account'). addCondition(condition). run(); or we can write it in one statement, which is identical to the first example we saw in this section. List accounts = new Query('Account'). addCondition( Query.doOr( Query.conditionEq('Name', 'Sam'), Query.doAnd( Query.conditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0), Query.conditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}) ) ) ). run(); We can still call 'addConditionXX' methods and 'addCondition' simultaneously, which by default, will combine the conditions with boolean 'and' operations, unless calling the 'switchToDisjunction' method explicitly: List accounts = new Query('Account'). addCondition( Query.doOr( Query.conditionEq('Name', 'Sam'), Query.conditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0) ) ). addConditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}). run(); which is equivalent to: List accounts = new Query('Account'). addCondition( Query.doAnd( Query.doOr( Query.conditionEq('Name', 'Sam'), Query.conditionGt('NumberOfEmployees', 0) ), Query.conditionIn('Phone', new Set{'+61 400 000 000'}) ) ). run(); After this section, you will be capable of creating a query with any complex conditions.

But before that, let's review how a subquery works in Salesforce: Take the objects Account and Contact as an example. Contact object has a lookup field (foreign key) pointing to a Contact, so Account is the parent of Contact, and in reverse Contact is the child of Account. We already saw that in previous sections, when querying the Contact object, it's also possible to get the fields in the parent object, which is Account object in this case. However, it would be slightly more complicated when trying to query a field from a child. Here is an example of such a query in SOQL: SELECT Name, (SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account In this case, 'Contacts' is the child relationship name, and the query inside the parentheses is a subquery. Let's see how to construct such a query using Query.apex: List accounts = new Query('Account'). addSubquery( Query.subquery('Contacts'). selectFields('FirstName, LastName') ). run(); Similar to the condition, we need to construct a subquery using the static method 'subquery', which takes a child relationship name as a parameter, before calling the 'addSubquery' member method. Here is another example of a subquery with conditions and limits: List accounts = new Query('Account'). addSubquery( Query.subquery('Contacts'). addConditionEq('FirstName', 'Sam'). addConditionIn('LastName', new List{'Tarly'}) ). run(); As we can see, after constructing the subquery, we can still do field selection and add conditions using the same methods in Query. Using a combination of the methods above, we should be able to build a query with a subquery in any complexity.
